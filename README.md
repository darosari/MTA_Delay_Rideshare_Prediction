# MTA Delay & Rideshare Demand Prediction

This data science project applies **machine learning** to model and predict **rideshare demand in New York City** based on **MTA subway delay patterns**. It was developed as a collaborative group assignment for a graduate-level course in data mining and analytics.

---

## Problem Statement
Urban mobility in NYC relies heavily on public transportation. But when the subway system experiences delays, do more people turn to rideshare services like Uber and Lyft?

**Goal:** Use NYC MTA delay data to predict daily rideshare counts and understand how transit disruptions affect alternative transportation demand.
